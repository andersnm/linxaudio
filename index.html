<h1>linxaudio</h1>
<p>
System for generating VST and Buzz audio plugins from DSP graph descriptions
in JSON format and precompiled modules without a compiler or full development
environment.
</p>

<p>
	Download: <a href="linxaudio-0.0.1.zip">linxaudio-0.0.1.zip</a> (Windows binaries)
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Supports using 32 bit x86 object files (COFF) created by Visual C/C++,
and generates Windows PE executables. The long term plan includes supporting
other architectures such as x64 and ARM, other compilers such as gcc and clang,
and other operating systems such as Linux and Mac.
</p>

<h1>linx modules</h1>
<p>
A module is a basic unit of operation, f.ex a filter or an oscillator, and
exposes its capabilities through input and output pins. 
</p>
<p>
Modules can be connected and chained in the DSP graph, forming edges between
modules' output and input pins.
</p>
<p>
A module pin is defined by its direction - either output or input - and a
datatype. Output pins can be connected to compatible input pins. The possible
datatypes are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>float
	<li>integer
	<li>float buffer
	<li>midi
</ul>
<p>
Some kinds of modules support subgraph processing, in which modules can defer
parts of its processing to a separate user-defined subgraph. Until more
documentation becomes available, please refer f.ex to the delay.json example.
</p>
<p>
	Example module source code: <a href="gain.c.txt">gain.c</a><br />
</p>

<h1>linxgen</h1>
<p>
linxgen.exe is a tool to compile JSON and link object files into a shared
library executable (DLL) usable by your preferred DAW host.
</p>
<p>
Directory structure:
</p>
<ul>
		<li>linxgen.exe
		<li>sample.json
		<li>delay.json
		<li>lib/*.obj
</ul>
<p>
	Example JSON: <a href="delay.json.txt">delay.json</a><br />
</p>
<p>
Usage to create delayVST.dll plugin for VST hosts:
</p>
<pre>
	linxgen delay.json vst-win32
</pre>
<p>
Usage to create delayBuzz.dll plugin for Buzz (or Buze):
</p>
<pre>
	linxgen delay.json buzz-win32
</pre>

<h1>Licensing and notes on commercial use</h1>
<p>
linxgen.exe is made from code primarily licenced under the LGPL. This license
applies only to the graph compiler and linker, and *not* the executable output
files created by the tool.
</p>
<p>
However, most of the standard modules included with linxgen are released under
the LGPL as well, so any executables using standard modules will still fall
under the LGPL!
</p>
<p>
The core graph code and host interface implementations are licenced under the 
BSD-license. This permits advanced users to create and redistribute plugins
under any license, provided *none* of the LGPL standard libraries and modules
are used.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that JSON graph description files also automatically fall under the
LGPL when using the standard libraries and modules. The LGPL does not permit
distribution of executable binaries unless all the source code is also made
available. The JSON is a vital part of the plugin source code.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to keep the development of the core tools and libraries open, but
still allow private and commercial use by advanced users.
